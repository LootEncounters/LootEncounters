# LootEncounters

## Dungeon and dragons book style (total text-based)

1. First the game starts by user choosing which Loot Class (LC)  to use to determine the class and the Loot Class Abilities (LCA), then Ability Score (AS) to determine the stats and LOOT as the equipments of the user.

Upon character creation, we will generate the HP, SP, Gold and XP of the player.

2. Then upon initialisation the game proceeds with a daily adventure to be done, each day the user is presented with an adventure (PVE)

3. User will have 2-3 options to select on the adventure, each option leads to another storyline

4. On each adventure, user increases level thereby increasing the stats or equipments

5. Upon increasing level, new ERC20 tokens are issued to the player which can be used to upgrade equipment (these ERC20 tokens are also tradeable in a DEX)

6. On a daily/weekly basis, all Encounters players can battle each other in an arena to further increase experience. Players who lost in the arena lose both experience and ERC20 tokens. (PVP)

7. The daily adventure will be a constant random scenario (similar to the D&D book style)
